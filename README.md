# Excel-Number-to-Words-Indian-Rupee-System-without-VBA

MS Excel or Google Sheets Formula that converts Numbers into Words. No VBA Coding is required.

Use the below formula to convert numbers into words. Don't forget to replace the cell "K11" with your numbered cell reference. (e.g: First you need to remove "=" , then open Find & Replace tool. Search for "K11", then type your cell reference in Replace field, like "B15", and click "Replace All". Place the "=" again. it's done!
